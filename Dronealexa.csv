MICRO UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE AND METHOD OF CONTROL THEREFOR,https://lens.org/080-937-406-565-429,2014,"A micro unmanned aerial vehicle or drone (""UAV"") 10 is remotely controlled through an HMI (309), although this remote control is supplemented by and selectively suppressed by an on-board controller (302). The controller operates to control the generation of a sonar bubble that generally encapsulates the UAV. The sonar bubble, which may be ultrasonic in nature, is produced by a multiplicity of sonar lobes generated by specific sonar emitters associated with each axis of movement for the UAV. The emitters produce individual and beamformed sonar lobes (80-102) that partially overlap to provide stereo or bioptic data in the form of individual echo responses detected by axis- specific sonar detectors (40-68). In this way, the on-board controller is able to interpret and then generate 3-D spatial imaging of the physical environment in which the UAV is currently moving or positioned. The controller is therefore able to plot relative and absolute movement of the UAV through the 3-D space by recording measurements from on-board gyroscopes (342), magnetometers (344) and accelerometers (346). Data from the sonar bubble can therefore both proactively prevent collisions with objects by imposing a corrective instruction to rotors (12-18) and other flight control system and can also assess and compensate for sensor drift."

MICRO UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE AND METHOD OF CONTROL THEREFOR,https://lens.org/137-826-656-551-761,2015,"A micro unmanned aerial vehicle or drone (“UAV”) 10 is remotely controlled through an HMI, although this remote control is supplemented by and selectively suppressed by an on-board controller. The controller operates to control the generation of a sonar bubble that generally encapsulates the UAV. The sonar bubble, which may be ultrasonic in nature, is produced by a multiplicity of sonar lobes generated by specific sonar emitters associated with each axis of movement for the UAV. The emitters produce individual and beamformed sonar lobes that partially overlap to provide stereo or bioptic data in the form of individual echo responses detected by axis-specific sonar detectors. In this way, the on-board controller is able to interpret and then generate 3-D spatial imaging of the physical environment in which the UAV is currently moving or positioned. The controller is therefore able to plot relative and absolute movement of the UAV through the 3-D space by recording measurements from on-board gyroscopes, magnetometers and accelerometers. Data from the sonar bubble can therefore both proactively prevent collisions with objects by imposing a corrective instruction to rotors and other flight control system and can also assess and compensate for sensor drift."

The mitigation of the noise effects is achieved by filtering and a cancellation technique. With the cancellation technique, the noise part contained in the signal captured by the noise acquisition components is equalized to the noise part contained in an audio signal carrying the voice commands and then it is subtracted from the audio signal."

This arm is practical for applications such as a routine police traffic stop, wherein an officer can safely remain in their vehicle and interact with the driver via a drone equipped with communication equipment and such an arm. The drone's arm can present the driver with a box for gathering documents from the driver without risk of injuring the driver or damaging the driver's vehicle. This is accomplished by two inventive “L”-shaped trusses that offset the arm's payload horizontally as the arm is extended downward."

SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR GAMIFICATION OF DRONE BEHAVIOR USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,https://lens.org/050-047-300-607-173,2019,"A conventional drone with an image sensor can track an object identified by a user in its image sensor's field of view. The user draws a bounding box around the object, and as long as the drone keeps the object in the bounding box, the drone can track the object. Unfortunately, this tracking scheme isn't robust; if the object changes shape or aspect ratio or is occluded by another object, the drone will lose the object. Using a neural network to identify the object in the image stream from the image sensor increases the robustness of the tracking; a trained neural network can recognize the object from a variety of angles without any user input (no user-drawn bounding box necessary). Moreover, if the neural network is a lifelong deep neural network (L-DNN), it can learn new objects on the fly. The drone can respond by moving in a predetermined fashion with respect to the object."

DRONE FOR PAINTING OUTER WALL OF MULTI-STORY BUILDING,https://lens.org/094-940-097-551-415,2022,"The present invention relates to a drone for painting an outer wall of a multi-story building and, more specifically, to a painting drone which can float and move in the air and comprises a drone body and a floating and moving part for floating and moving the drone body in the air. A camera unit for obtaining an image of the outer surface of a building is provided on the drone body. Driving wheels for guidance to the outer surface of the building are provided on one surface of the drone body. Absorption angle members are further formed on the drone body in order to absorb the impact from the building. Paint nozzle parts for painting by spraying paint on the outer surface of the building are further formed on the drone body. By using a drone which can float and move in the air to paint an outer wall of a skyscraper, cost or painting the sky scraper can be reduced, the painting work can be simplified, fatal accidents due to falls can be prevented, and painting time can be shortened."
